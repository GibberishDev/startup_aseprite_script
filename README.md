# Startup Aseprite script

### Installation
1) Download source code from github as zip
2) Extract to "scripts" foulder in Aseprite directory(accessible via Aseprite itself via 'File>Scripts>Open Scripts Folder')
3) Upon executing any startup script aseprite will prompt user if script is trusted due to script reading png files in scripts foulder. It is up to you if you trust me :P but for quick install I would recomend full trust or manually go thru all startup options and mark every one as trusted.
